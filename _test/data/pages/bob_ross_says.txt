====== Bob Ross says ======

It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. The least little bit can do so much. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Put it in, leave it alone. With practice comes confidence. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
